When it comes to rules, we like to think ourselves an evolved organization. If you can refrain from being a horrible internet troll, we'll all get along. But, sometimes there needs to be a codified document with rules, such as they are. This is that. Rules broken will lead to strikes. Three strikes and you're out. Moderators and club admins reserve the right to skip directly to a ban if the infraction merits it. Please note that appeals are only ever granted to those who are truly sorry, and that there are no third chances.

Note that these rules apply both to this website, and to the main Discord server. 

## The Rules

1. Be respectful of each other, moderators, and administrators. Treat each other as you would like to be treated.
2. Do not spam.
3. Do not dox.
4. All spoilers must be either warned ahead of time, or must be marked out with Discord's spoiler tool.
5. Refrain from discussing non-book related politics outside of approved places.
6. Avoid genre shaming. Not everyone likes the same things.
7. If a Moderator or Admin warns you to stop a behavior, please stop. Warnings will only be given once. After that a strike will be dealt out.
