Welcome to The Bookies! We're a group of nerds who love reading books. Whether it's fantasy, science fiction, mystery or even a little romance, we love it all. Join us as we read together books both on and off the beaten path. On this site, we publish selected reviews from our members, thoughts on the books we read, and more. 

If you'd like to join, you can join the waitlist here. We're currently growing our membership slowly. Membership is granted on a first come first serve basis as slots open up.
